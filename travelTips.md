## Taking a TAXI at the Airport

Right after leaving the customs clearance area, but before leaving the terminal, there are stands of official taxi companies that you can prepay, with credit card, avoiding fare surprises.

Please don't follow or accept taxi drivers offering rides at the lobby. They are not legal or official (or safe!), and the fares will be overrated.
