An advanced, working-focused workshop will be held at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden aiming to advance the field of Socio-Ecological Systems through the lens of network theory and computational techniques.

A small team of top-leading scientists from all over the world will soon be invited to gather around seminars, round-tables and working groups to discuss the recent advances in the field that will produce a manuscript and friendly tool to analyse SES (likely an R package).
