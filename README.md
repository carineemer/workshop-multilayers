An advanced, working-focused workshop will be held at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden aiming to advance the field of Multilayer Networks applied to Socio-Ecological Systems.

A small team of top-leading scientists from all over the world will soon be invited to gather around seminars, round-tables and working groups to discuss the recent advances in the field that will produce a manuscript and a working package for R.

* __Date__: 25 - 28 April 2023.
* __Venue__: [Auditorium of the National School of Tropical Botany - Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/1fKVPoujeVyQxCr77) (in person).
* __Sponsor__: Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Supporting Research in the State of Rio de Janeiro - FAPERJ.
